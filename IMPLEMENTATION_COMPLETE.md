## 🚀 How to Test & Use

### **Building the Application**
```bash
# Restore dependencies and build
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Run the application
dotnet run --project Unibot
```

### **Basic Usage Workflow**
1. **Launch Unibot** - Modern interface opens with Detection panel active
2. **Configure Detection** - Set HSV color ranges for your game's enemies
3. **Adjust FOV Settings** - Set detection and aim field of view areas
4. **Configure Aim** - Set speed, smoothing, and targeting preferences
5. **Setup Communication** - Choose input method (WinAPI recommended for testing)
6. **Test with Preview** - Use Debug panel to verify color detection works
7. **Start Unibot** - Click the start button when ready

### **Testing the Live Preview**
1. Navigate to **Debug & Preview** panel
2. Click **"Start Preview"** button
3. The preview window shows real-time screen capture
4. Test color detection by pointing at colored objects
5. Adjust HSV ranges until detection works properly

### **Configuration Testing**
1. Modify any settings in the interface
2. Close and reopen the application
3. Settings should be automatically restored
4. Press F1 to reload configuration manually
