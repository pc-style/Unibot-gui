## About

This is a complete rewrite of Unibot in C# with a modern WPF interface. The application provides the same powerful features as the original Python version but with a sleek, professional dark-themed GUI.

### Key Features

- **üéØ Aim Assist** - Advanced color-based target detection with smooth aim interpolation
- **üî´ Triggerbot** - Automatic shooting when crosshair is on target
- **üî• Rapid Fire** - High-speed clicking for semi-automatic weapons  
- **üéÆ Recoil Control** - Intelligent recoil compensation with multiple modes
- **üìä Real-time Preview** - Live visual feedback of target detection
- **‚öôÔ∏è Modern Interface** - Compact tabbed interface with real-time configuration

### Interface Design

The application features a sleek, modern, and professional-looking interface with:
- **Dark Theme** - Dark gray background with vibrant blue accents
- **Tabbed Organization** - Settings organized into logical categories:
  - Screen & Detection - Color ranges, FOV, capture settings
  - Aim Settings - Speed, smoothing, targeting preferences  
  - Recoil & Trigger - Recoil compensation and triggerbot configuration
  - Communication - Hardware connection options
  - Debug & Preview - Live target detection preview
- **Compact Design** - Scaled to fit normal screen resolutions
- **Real-time Status** - Live indicators for aim, trigger, and recoil states

### Communication Methods

Supports multiple input methods just like the original:
- **WinAPI** - Direct Windows mouse events (default)
- **Interception Driver** - Low-level input interception
- **Serial (COM Port)** - Arduino Leonardo/Pi Pico hardware
- **Socket (Network)** - Wi-Fi/Ethernet connected devices

### Advanced Features

- **HSV Color Detection** - Precise target identification using OpenCV
- **Sub-pixel Accuracy** - Smooth mouse movement with remainder tracking
- **Rate Limiting** - Configurable click speeds and delays
- **Randomized Timing** - Human-like input patterns
- **Hot-reload Configuration** - F1 to reload settings without restart
- **Multi-threaded Processing** - Smooth 60+ FPS operation

## Building from Source

To build the project from source, you'll need the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) installed.

### Manual Build

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Unibot-gui.git
   cd Unibot-gui
   ```
2. **Restore dependencies and build the project:**
   ```sh
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   The executable will be located in `Unibot/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/Unibot.exe`.

### Automated Builds (GitHub Actions)

This repository includes automated build workflows:

#### üîÑ **Continuous Integration** 
- **Triggers**: Push to `main`/`develop` branches, Pull Requests to `main`
- **Process**: Automatically builds, tests, and uploads artifacts on every code change
- **Artifacts**: Build outputs available for download for 30 days
- **Status**: ![Build Status](https://github.com/your-repo/Unibot-gui/workflows/Build%20Unibot/badge.svg)

#### üöÄ **Automated Releases**
- **Triggers**: Version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.0.1-beta`)
- **Process**: Creates distributable packages automatically
- **Outputs**:
  - `Unibot-v1.0.0-win-x64-standalone.zip` - Self-contained (no .NET required)
  - `Unibot-v1.0.0-framework-dependent.zip` - Requires .NET 8 Runtime
- **Features**: Automatic changelog generation, GitHub releases

#### üì¶ **Creating a Release**

To create a new release:

1. **Tag your commit:**
   ```sh
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Automatic Process:**
   - GitHub Actions builds both standalone and framework-dependent versions
   - Creates a GitHub release with download links
   - Generates changelog with installation instructions
   - Uploads artifacts for long-term storage

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Build Configurations**

| Build Type | Description | Requirements | Size |
|------------|-------------|--------------|------|
| **Standalone** | Single executable with .NET embedded | None | ~150MB |
| **Framework-Dependent** | Requires .NET 8 Desktop Runtime | .NET 8 | ~15MB |

#### üìã **Workflow Files**

- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Continuous integration workflow
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release automation workflow

Both workflows use Windows runners to ensure compatibility with WPF applications.

## Technical Implementation

Built with modern .NET 8 and WPF, utilizing:
- **OpenCV Sharp** - Advanced computer vision processing
- **Modern WPF UI** - Contemporary interface components
